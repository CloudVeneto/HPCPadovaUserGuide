Overview of the INFN Padova HPC Cluster
=======================================

The resources provided by the INFN Padova HPC cluster are the following:

*  6 CPU only nodes cld-ter-01..06: each node has 2 AMD EPYC 9654 processors
   (192 Cores, 384 threads in total) and 1.5 TB of RAM
*  6 CPU-GPU nodes cld-ter-gpu-01..06: each node has 2 AMD EPYC 9654 processors
   (192 Cores, 384 threads in total), 1.5 TB of RAM and 4 NVIDIA H100 GPUs

The nodes are interconnected through a high bandwith, low latency Infiniband network.

Such resources are managed through the SLURM resource manager.


Available SLURM partitions
--------------------------
A Slurm partition exposes a set of resources, with some possible
constraints (e.g. on the number of maximum running jobs, on the job time
limit, etc.).

IN the INFN Padova HPC cluster the following partitions are available:

Who can use the INFN Padova HPC cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The INFN Padova HPC cluster has been funded by the Terabit PNRR project and therefore
it can be used for use cases relevant for the project (that must be approved by the
relevant bodies).				       
						     

Available unused resources can be used opportunistically in low priority mode by
local INFN Padova users.
